# Anthro Drills

Multiple-choice study drills for **ANTH 102: Introduction to Human Evolution**. They're built from the course's Top Hat questions, Brightspace activities and lecture slides.

| Drill | Folder | Subject tabs |
|---|---|---|
| Exam 1 | `exam1/` | Science · Natural selection · Scientists · Cells & DNA · Protein synthesis · Genetics · Forces of evolution (192 questions) |
| Exam 2 | `exam2/` | Speciation · Phylogeny · Primate traits · Taxonomy · Picture ID · Sociality · Chimps & bonobos (186 questions, including the 36 original worksheet questions) |
| Classification | `classification/` | Where traits go · Chart structure · Compare & connect (149 questions) + `chart.html` drag-and-drop chart |

Each drill also has a **Mixed** tab and a **Progress** tab. Tabs group questions by subject; every question shows a "Source:" label above it (Top Hat, a Brightspace activity, a worksheet, or practice).

Everything is plain static HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no build step and no server code.

## How progress is saved

Each student's progress is saved **in their own browser, on the device they study on** (`localStorage`). Nothing is sent to a server, there are no accounts, and classmates never see each other's data.

- Every answer is recorded per question: attempts, correct answers, current streak, and when the streak started.
- **Mastery** is stricter than "got it right once". A question is *mastered* only when it's answered right **3 times in a row** (4 for two-choice questions, so a lucky guess streak stays under about 6%), and that streak **spans at least an hour**, so it reflects memory, not the screen just seen. A miss resets the streak. A mastered question not seen for **5 days** becomes *due for review*.
- Each question has a level: New → Learning (last answer wrong) → Getting there (streak building) → Mastered (or Due for review). Rounds serve the weakest levels first.
- A topic's **mastery score** gives full credit for mastered, ¾ for due and ½ for getting there. The rules live at the top of `assets/drill.js` (`SPACING`, `FADE`, `need`).
- The **Progress** tab in each drill shows overall accuracy, accuracy by topic (weakest first), strongest and weakest areas, and the most-missed questions. Each row has a **Practice** button that starts a focused round.
- Exam 1 and Exam 2 keep separate histories (`ant1-progress-v2` and `ant2-progress-v1`).
- History doesn't move between devices or browsers, and it's erased if the student clears their browser data. Safari can also clear it after about 7 days without a visit.

## What students see

- **Subject tabs** with a small mastery bar each, a **Mixed** tab, and a **Progress** tab.
- A **question map**: one square per question in the round, colored by mastery level, with a dot once answered and an outline on the current question.
- How many questions you answered today and your day streak, in the header (no quota).
- Instant feedback: a pop on right answers, a shake on wrong ones, the explanation, the question's mastery level and streak. After a right answer the next question comes up on its own (switch off under **Options**); any tap pauses it.
- Short messages for 5/10/15/20… in a row and for newly mastered questions.
- **Free browsing:** ← Previous and Next → (or Skip) move through the round, and every square in the question map is a button that jumps to that question. Skipped questions can be answered later; answered ones open read-only.
- End-of-round summary with score, newly mastered count, best streak and the weakest subject to practice next.
- **Mark as mastered / Mark for review** buttons on every question. A student's own "mastered" mark counts as mastered (it still fades after 5 days, and a miss removes it); flagged questions get a dot on their square, come first in rounds, and can be drilled from the Progress tab.
- **Classification drill** (`classification/`): 149 questions from the Primate Classification worksheet (36 written + 113 generated from its answer key), kept separate from the Exam 2 drill. The generator in `classification/questions.js` runs in a fixed order; add new ones only at the end. Exam 2 shows a dismissible prompt to study it, since the chart is on the study guide.
- **Drag-and-drop chart** (`classification/chart.html`): drag worksheet traits onto the chart (word bank beside the chart on wide screens, docked tray at the bottom on phones and iPad portrait), or tap a trait and then a box. Built on Pointer Events so mouse, touch and pen all work. Mistakes, hints and time are tracked; best result saved per device.
- Tap any picture to zoom.
- **Reading settings** (Options menu): choose the reading font (IBM Plex Sans, Atkinson Hyperlegible, Literata, or the device's own font) and text size (4 steps). Saved per device and shared by both drills; extra fonts download only when chosen.
- The landing page shows a countdown to Exam 2, a **Continue** button that opens the weakest subject (`exam2/index.html#continue`), and each exam's mastery bar.

## Mock exam

`mock/index.html` builds a fresh 50- or 100-question exam (student's choice, 50 by default) each time from the Exam 2 and Classification drills (288 unique questions; shared and repeated questions appear once). Answers can be changed until submitting; results show the score, a subject breakdown and a full review. Exams in progress and past scores are saved per device.

The mock exam reads `mock/bank.js`, which is generated. **After changing either question bank, run:**

```bash
node tools/build-mock.js
```

## Project layout

```
index.html            landing page
assets/drill.css      shared styles
assets/drill.js       shared app: rounds, scoring, saved progress, Progress tab
exam1/questions.js    Exam 1 questions and topics
exam2/questions.js    Exam 2 questions and topics
exam*/index.html      page shell for each drill
exam*/img/            question figures
```

## Run it locally

Opening `index.html` directly works, but a local server is closer to the real site:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Add questions to Exam 2

All Exam 2 questions live in `exam2/questions.js`. Each question is one line:

```js
["Tag shown above the question", "Question text?", "Correct answer", ["Wrong 1", "Wrong 2", "Wrong 3"], "Optional explanation", "optionalFigureKey"],
```

- **Append new questions to the end of a source list** (`TH`, `A5`, `CH`, `WS`, `PR`); the source becomes the question's origin label. Progress is stored by position, so inserting in the middle would shift people's saved history onto the wrong questions.
- To attach a picture, put the file in `exam2/img/`, add an entry to `FIG` at the top of the file, and use its key as the sixth item.
- The question's **subject tab** (also used on the Progress tab) comes from its tag, through the `TOPIC2` lists near the bottom of the file. A tag that isn't listed falls back to the tab's name, so add new tags to the right topic.
- To add a whole new tab, add an entry to `DECKS`, a new array, and include it in `DATA`.

## Publish it on Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository (see the first two steps below).
2. On <https://vercel.com/new>, import the repository.
3. Set **Framework Preset** to **Other**, leave **Build Command** empty, and leave **Output Directory** as the project root.
4. Deploy. Vercel gives you a link like `https://anthro-drills.vercel.app` to share. Every later push redeploys automatically.

You can also deploy straight from this folder, without GitHub:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## Publish it on GitHub Pages

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub, for example `anthro-drills`.
2. Push this folder:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/anthro-drills.git
   ```

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**. Under **Build and deployment**, pick **Deploy from a branch**, then select `main` and `/ (root)`, and save.
4. After a minute the site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/anthro-drills/`. Share that link.

Netlify and Cloudflare Pages also work: point either one at the repository with no build command and the publish directory set to `/`.

## Where the questions come from

Every question was gathered from, or written to match, ANTH 102 class materials: Top Hat questions, Brightspace activities, worksheets, the in-class Anthro-pardy game, the lecture slides and the Exam 2 study guide. Exam 2 practice questions are labeled either "from the lecture slides" or "from the study guide"; the second group covers study-guide topics that weren't in the slides used, and students are told to check those against their notes. The landing page lists the count per source (update it when adding questions).

## A note on content

The question figures are cropped from course slides and screenshots. They're shared here as a study aid for classmates and aren't official course material.
